This has come about because I wanted to be able to run resque jobs later with the following criteria:

* saying in how many seconds it should run
* if I trigger the exact same job, including params, as one already being delayed, just delay the existing one further without adding the duplicate job
* have a limit to how long a job can be continuously delayed for
* don't loose jobs if it crashes

Todo:

* testing ;-)
* example rails app using it
* being smart about the timeouts, should work out when the next job is due to go and trigger then instead of every second (this was a quickly slapped together proof of concept after all)
